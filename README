Rinse
-----

  The rinse utility is designed to install a minimal RPM-based
 distribution of GNU/Linux within a local directory.

  The purpose and usage are analogous to the 'debootstrap' utility
 familiar to users of Debian GNU/Linux.


Rationale
---------

  This tool is being developed primarily for use by the xen-tools
 software, so that new Xen guests may be easily created running
 RPM-based distributions of GNU/Linux. It's also used by FAI (Fully
 Automatic Installation) for rpm based installations.

  RPMStrap is the common solution to this problem, however it
 is rarely successful.
