Rinse
-----

  The rinse utility is designed to install a minimal RPM-based
 distribution of GNU/Linux within a local directory.

  The purpose and usage are analogous to the 'debootstrap' utility
 familiar to users of Debian GNU/Linux.


Rationale
---------

  This tool is being developed primarily for use by the xen-tools
 software, so that new Xen guests may be easily created running
 RPM-based distributions of GNU/Linux.

  RPMStrap is the common solution to this problem, however it
 is rarely successful.


Supported Distributions
-----------------------

  So far the following distributions are supported, in both
 32 and 64 bit flavours:

     *  CentOS
        - 4.5 & 5.0

     *  Fedora Core
        - 4, 5, 6, & 7.

  Additional distributions might be supported in the future,
 and more will be certainly be added if submitted for inclusion
 in newer releases.
